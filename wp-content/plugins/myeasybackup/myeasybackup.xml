<h4>1.0.8 - Released: 23 July 2011</h4>
<p>All the images and javascript code is now loaded from the same server where the plugin is installed.<br />
Last year I tought it might be useful to have the myeasy common images and code loaded from a CDN to avoid having to update all the plugins in the series each time an image changes and to load pages faster; so I moved all the common items to a CDN.<br />
Today I received a kind email from wordpress.org letting me know that "there a potential malicious intent issue here as you {me} could change the files to embed malicious code and nobody would be the wiser" and asking me to change the code.<br />
I promptly reacted to show everyone that I am 101% in bona fide and here is a new version.</p>

<h4>0.1.1 - Released: 15 April 2010</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed &mdash; myEASYbackup : Changed the code to allow IE users to download data sets.</li>
    <li>Fixed &mdash; myEASYbackup : Fixed a security issue with the myEASYrestore.ini file, now renamed myEASYrestore_ini.php and added a some code to prevent showing its contents from a browser.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.0.9 - Released: 3 April 2010</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed &mdash; myEASYbackup : When saving only the MySQL tables, the myEASYrestore.ini and the wp-config.php files were not included in the data set, making it impossible to restore the data with the restore tool and to amend, if needed, the WordPress configuration.</li>
    <li>Changed &mdash; myEASYbackup  &amp; myEASYrestore : Until now most of the support requests were coming from users unable to backup/restore as their providers blocked the use of the PHP <code>system()</code> command. For this reason I decided to change the behaviour of the plugin that now uses PHP code rather than the <code>system()</code> by default. If you know that <code>system()</code> is enabled on your servers you can still use it by unselecting the 'Use PHP code rather than system() commands' checkbox through the `Setting -> myEASYbackup` menu. Using the <code>system()</code> let's you backup/restore faster as relies on the server commands to perform operations on the MySQL database and compressing/uncompressing the data set. Using PHP code can create issues when the MySQL database is very big &mdash; rest assured that I will do my best to avoid putting limits on your databases size when/if, in the future, the problem will arise ;-)</li>
    <li>Added &mdash; myEASYrestore : Ability to restore data sets created with the 'Use PHP code rather than system() commands' option enabled. <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Warning</span>: you <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">MUST</span> save your data set with myEASYbackup 0.0.9 <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">AND</span> using PHP code in order to be able to restore using PHP code.</li>
    <li>Added &mdash; myEASYrestore : Now changing paths in the `option_value` field (`options` table) only if the path is changed.</li>
    <li>Added &mdash; myEASYrestore : Now showing the number of records updated by the queries replacing values in the tables.</li>
    <li>Added &mdash; myEASYrestore : Some additional classes in the style header.</li>
    <li>Added &mdash; myEASYrestore : Ability to remove also the .zip file (only the one selected in the 'Backups available on this server in the following folder' section).</li>
    <li>Added &mdash; myEASYrestore : When the restore is completed successfully the data set ini file is automatically removed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.0.8 - Released: 23 March 2010</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed : Added a query to modify the `guid` field in the `posts` table when migrating/restoring a database.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.0.7 - Released: 14 March 2010</h4>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed : When uploading 20Mb and larger data sets, setting the FTP connection in passive mode was not enough to get green light on the upload. To be sure the upload went correctly through I have added a check on the size of the local data set against the uploaded file, if the size are the same I can issue the ok message.</li>
    <li>Fixed : Added indications about the percentage and estimated remaining time for the upload.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.0.6 - Released: 13 MArch 2010</h4>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed : When compressing with the system tools, the zipped file does not include the complete path anymore.</li>
    <li>Fixed : When uploading 20Mb and larger data sets, sometimes the upload was reported unsuccessfull even if was completed succesfully. Setting the FTP connection in passive mode seems to fix the problem.</li>
    <li>Fixed : In some cases the wait message (the semi-transparent black screen) did not show the images.</li>
    <li>Added : When preparing a data set, create an .ini file used by the myEASYrestore tool.</li>
    <li>Added : When uploading you can choose to upload the myEASYrestore script that will let you easily restore your data set.</li>
    <li>Added : Russian and Spanish translations.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.0.5 - Released: 6 March 2010</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed : Avoid to issue a warning message when setting infinite time limit, needed to avoid possible interruption while creating/saving big data sets.</li>
    <li>Fixed : Now working even on `system()` disabled servers.</li>
    <li>Fixed : Blocked the execution on safe_mode enabled servers, it will soon be deprecated so there is no need to loose time on that.</li>
    <li>Added : Settings page with a number of options like, for example: show/hide debug info, compression level (only on `system()` enabled servers), etc.</li>
    <li>Added : Ability to upload a data set to the same or a different server.</li>
    <li>Added : Italian translation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: once the upload code will be stabilized I will add some more features like, for example, the ability to restore the tables data and the WordPress installation folder in the proper locations.</p>
<h4>0.0.4 - Released: 1 March 2010</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed : Now faster as, on Linux servers, does use the zip command to compress. On Windows servers it requires the ZipArchive extension, however I changed the code to create a better zip file.</li>
    <li>Fixed : Info about installing the ZipArchive extention are provided by the plugin if it does not find it installed, however you can have a look at the <a href="http://php.net/manual/zip.installation.php" target="_blank">ZipArchive page on the PHP site</a></li>

    <li>Fixed : If the PHP version is too old or the ZipArchive class is not installed instruction are provided through a number of useful links.</li>
    <li>Added : A check on the installed PHP version as well as the required ZipArchive class.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.0.1 - Released: 13 February 2010</h4>
